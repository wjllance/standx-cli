"""Pooled markout / toxicity comparison for stage2 A/B maker arms. Read-only.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/maker_markout_ab.py ARM.ndjson [ARM.ndjson ...]

Each arm file is a maker NDJSON log whose name contains "baseline" or
"candidate" (treatment is inferred from the filename). Prints per-arm
fill/capture/markout stats, pooled per-treatment aggregates, a
matched-condition cut (candidate tier-0 fills vs baseline), and candidate
fills broken down by adaptive-spread tier.

Attribution sections (pooled across all arms, treatment shown for reference):

- Pre-fill signed drift: for each passive fill, drift_in(w) =
  (mark_at_fill - mark(t_fill - w)) * side_sign / mark_at_fill in bps for
  w in 5/15/30s. drift_in < 0 means the pre-fill mark drift was in the
  "run-over" direction (mark fell into our bid / rose into our ask — the
  aggressor flow pushed price the same way). If most fills show drift_in < 0
  and those fills carry the negative markout, quotes are systematically run
  over by drift and drift-aware asymmetric quoting targets the cause.
- Resting-order age at fill: per-side replay of place / cancel /
  place_rejected_async events attributes each passive fill to the placement
  of the order it matched (single level per side; price must match exactly).
  Age is wall-clock seconds from place intent to fill. If toxicity worsens
  with age, faster requote (refresh tuning, a pure config change) has value.
  The hold-event mean age_cycles x cycle period gives the time-weighted
  resting-age benchmark: fills older than that benchmark mean old quotes are
  disproportionately the ones getting hit.
- Quote staleness at fill: each attributed fill is classified as "fresh"
  (drift since placement, toward the quote, below the tier's refresh_bps at
  fill time — the strategy still considered the quote good), "stale" (drift
  >= refresh_bps but no cancel intent logged yet, i.e. the fill landed in
  the <=1-cycle detection-lag window), or "in_flight" (the fill matched an
  order whose cancel intent was already logged within 30s). refresh_bps is
  taken per tier from the frozen stage2 config (4/5/6 bps for t0/t1/t2). A
  high stale+in_flight share would point at cancel/detection speed as the
  lever; a high fresh share means fills hit quotes the strategy stood
  behind, i.e. the quote center itself lacks short-term drift information.
- Signal pricing (offline, open-loop): per fill, drift_place(T) is the signed
  drift over the T seconds BEFORE PLACEMENT (endpoint = placement ref_mark) —
  the signal the strategy could actually act on at quote time. Predictive
  power is reported as pearson/spearman vs mo30 per T. The counterfactual
  front-run estimate shifts the quote center by o = min(cap, k *
  max(0, -drift_place(T))) bps and asks per fill: still filled (30s post-fill
  adverse mark excursion >= o, mark-touch proxy) => gain +o bps; avoided =>
  gain -(cap+mo30) bps. Combos are tuned ONLY on the training window (first
  4 arms chronologically) and reported frozen on the validation window (last
  2 arms). This step can only prove signal existence and rough magnitude:
  open-loop replay cannot generate counterfactual fills, ignores re-quote
  chains/inventory/uptime effects, and the mark-touch proxy deviates from
  real venue touches by the capture residual (~5bps). The real verdict
  requires live A/B.

Markout convention: (mark(t+h) - mark(t_fill)) * side_sign / mark * 1e4 bps,
using cycle_summary marks (~2.45s cadence) as the mark series; the actual
horizon is the first cycle at or after t_fill + h. The runner's own
performance.markout_* fields instead measure from the fill price (i.e. they
include capture), so the two conventions differ by ~capture_bps.
