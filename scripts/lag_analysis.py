"""Measure how far StandX's mark price lags Hyperliquid. Read-only, stdlib only.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/lag_analysis.py LAG.ndjson [--standx-field mark|mid|index]
                                    [--leader-field mark|mid|index]
                                    [--grid-ms 250] [--max-lag-ms 4000]
                                    [--event-bps 8] [--event-window-ms 2000]
                                    [--cover-frac 0.5]

Input is the NDJSON produced by `standx lag-recorder`: one price observation per
line, each tagged `source` ("standx" | "hyperliquid") with a common-clock
`local_recv_ms` and price fields (mark/mid/index/last/best_bid/best_ask).

Each source uses its own field: the leader (Hyperliquid) defaults to `mid`
(midPx, the fastest-moving public price on that feed), StandX to `mark` (the
price the maker quotes against). The earlier single `--field` option was
replaced by `--standx-field` / `--leader-field`.

Three statistics are printed:

1. Cross-correlation of resampled price increments across candidate lags. The
   lag maximizing correlation is the typical co-movement offset (positive =
   StandX lags Hyperliquid).
2. Event response: when Hyperliquid jumps sharply, how long until StandX covers
   a fraction of that move. More robust than (1) because it isolates the moments
   that actually matter (the jumps that snipe stale quotes), and it is directly
   causal (measured from realized price paths). Coverage outcomes (already
   ahead / never followed / measurable follow) are stratified by jump size in
   tiers of [1x, 2x, 4x, 8x) * --event-bps, so the exploitability of the window
   can be read per regime.
3. StandX own-feed jump response: for jumps detected on StandX's OWN series,
   how fast StandX's mark itself traverses 50% / 90% of the move. This prices
   an "own-feed fast cancel": how much of the move is still ahead of you once
   your own feed starts moving. StandX's mark updates at a slower cadence than
   the leader feed, so its jump scan uses a wider window (--own-window-ms,
   default 3x --event-window-ms).

HONEST CAVEATS (also printed at the end):
- The common local clock carries a FIXED differential-network-latency offset:
  the RTT from the recording host to StandX vs to Hyperliquid differs. The
  VARIABLE part (event-response spread, correlation shape) is robust; the
  ABSOLUTE offset is biased by that differential. Record from the SAME host /
  region as the maker for the number to be representative.
- Resolution floor: Hyperliquid activeAssetCtx (~0.5s/block) and StandX update
  cadence bound the smallest trustworthy lag. Treat sub-0.5s point estimates as
  "below resolution", not zero.
- Single window, single symbol. Re-record per symbol.
