# Agent Execution Guide

This file defines the repository-wide execution rules for coding agents. Human Git workflow remains documented in `WORKFLOW.md`.

## Source of Truth

- `standx-maker` owns deterministic market-making strategy, risk, accounting, and state-transition logic.
- `standx-sdk` owns exchange protocols, authentication, API models, HTTP/WebSocket clients, and transport health.
- `standx-cli` owns command-line configuration, live gating, asynchronous I/O orchestration, exchange reads and writes, telemetry, and user-facing output.
- Preserve this direction of dependency. Strategy and safety decisions must not depend on CLI types, terminal output, webhook delivery, Tokio tasks, or network clients.

## Maker Module Boundary

Move logic into `standx-maker` when all of the following are true:

- The result is deterministic for the same typed inputs.
- The logic can run in a replay or unit test without network, clock, environment, filesystem, or terminal access.
- The logic expresses strategy, risk, order ownership, session accounting, or maker runtime state transitions.
- Failures can be represented as typed results or domain errors rather than printed messages.

Typical `standx-maker` responsibilities include:

- Quote planning, skew, exposure caps, volatility breakers, and inventory-exit decisions.
- Current-run order ownership and bounded client-order-ID construction/parsing.
- WS/REST fill deduplication, partial-fill accounting, session PnL, and expected position.
- Position-limit and quantity-tolerance rules.
- Position-jump, threshold-crossing, and direction-flip detection.
- A pure event reducer that maps maker events to typed effects, including generation invalidation, freeze, cleanup, reconnect, recovery, and stop decisions.

Keep logic in `standx-cli` when it performs or directly coordinates side effects:

- REST/WebSocket connection, authentication, snapshots, subscriptions, reconnect execution, sleeps, and timeouts.
- Placing or cancelling orders and executing reduce-only exits.
- CLI/file/environment configuration merging and live authorization gates.
- JSON/terminal output, OpenObserve emission, webhook formatting, and notification delivery.
- Translating SDK payloads into normalized maker-domain inputs and executing effects returned by `standx-maker`.

Keep exchange-specific payload parsing and transport error classification in `standx-sdk` or a thin CLI adapter. Do not make core maker logic inspect loosely typed JSON or emit user-facing strings.

## Preferred Core Interfaces

- Prefer normalized domain events such as `LedgerEvent` over passing SDK `Trade` or `OrderUpdate` through the strategy core.
- Prefer typed outcomes such as `LedgerOutcome`, `PositionRiskEvent`, and `MakerEffect` over mutating unrelated CLI state.
- Reducers and planners must be pure: they return effects or intents and never execute I/O.
- The CLI runtime is an effect executor. It may translate, schedule, cancel, and report effects, but must not duplicate the safety decision inside ad-hoc branches.
- Keep account events and order-response events on one canonical ingestion path each.
- Use one authoritative current-run ledger for fills, expected position, and deduplication.

## Safety Invariants

- Account-stream loss, unexplained position mismatch, reconciliation timeout, or residual maker orders must fail closed.
- Entering a frozen state invalidates the current generation, prevents new placements, aborts cancellable in-flight work, clears queued actions, and schedules maker cleanup.
- Ignore outcomes from stale generations. Because an aborted request may already have reached the venue, cleanup is always the compensating action.
- Resume quoting only when required streams are healthy, the maker book is empty, and the venue position reconciles with the current-run ledger.
- WS and REST fills may arrive in either order. Partial, repeated, reconnected, and replayed updates must affect fills, PnL, and expected position exactly once.
- Historical `sxmk-` activity may be inspected for startup cleanup or verification but must not enter the current session ledger unless it belongs to the current run tag.
- Preserve existing JSON action names and fields unless an explicit output-contract change is requested.
- Do not change quote formulas, thresholds, PnL semantics, inventory-exit behavior, or live-gate defaults as an incidental part of a refactor.

## Refactoring Guidance

- Do not grow `standx-maker/src/lib.rs` into another monolith. Add focused modules such as `ledger`, `runtime`, `risk`, `ownership`, `planner`, `stats`, and `breaker`, then re-export the intended public API.
- Split mixed modules at the decision/effect boundary. For example, recovery policy belongs in `standx-maker`; REST queries, waits, cleanup calls, and reconnect attempts remain in `standx-cli`.
- Keep transport adapters small and explicit. Parse and validate SDK values once, then pass typed numeric/domain values to the maker crate.
- Avoid large parameter lists. Group stable inputs into context/request/state types with clear ownership.
- A refactor must retain observable trading order, failure behavior, telemetry schema, and configured policy unless the change explicitly states otherwise.

## Testing Requirements

For maker-core changes, add deterministic tests covering the relevant cases:

- WS then REST, REST then WS, duplicate fills, and partial-fill-then-cancelled orders.
- Position before order and order before position.
- External or wrong-run orders and fills.
- Generation invalidation and ignored stale outcomes.
- Freeze, cleanup, bounded recovery, residual-order stop, and reconciliation timeout.
- Quantity-tick boundaries, position jumps, direction flips, and inventory/max-position threshold crossings.

Before handing off a maker change, run:

```bash
HOME=/tmp/standx-test-home CARGO_HOME=~/.cargo cargo test --workspace --offline
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --offline -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
python3 -m py_compile scripts/openobserve_dashboard.py
```

Credential-dependent or production validation is separate from offline verification. Never place live orders, disconnect production streams, execute inventory exits, or flatten positions without explicit authorization for that specific exercise.
